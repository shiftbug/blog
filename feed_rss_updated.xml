I spent my summer in Japan visiting different onsens, and it was both a natural and spiritual experience. Before entering the water, everyone would bathe in the front, and kids would learn from their dads how to bathe. I would often sit on the edges of cliffs, gazing at the water or the sunrise, and it felt like we were monkeys, freely splashing about in nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the time I spent in LA or New York City at various bathhouses was different. No one looked like an animal; instead, everyone seemed focused on optimization. People barely bathed before entering the water, wearing their dirty little speedos and swim trunks that they had definitely peed in the month before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gross.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://jxnl.github.io/blog/writing/2024/01/18/public-baths/</link> <pubDate>Sun, 21 Jan 2024 19:10:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://jxnl.github.io/blog/feed_rss_updated.xml">jxnl.co</source><guid isPermaLink="true">https://jxnl.github.io/blog/writing/2024/01/18/public-baths/</guid> <enclosure url="https://jxnl.github.io/blog/assets/images/social/writing/posts/baths.png" type="image/png" length="27565" /> </item> <item> <title>Centuar Chess: AI as a Collaborative Partner</title> <author>jxnl</author> <category>LLM</category> <description>&lt;h1&gt;Centuar Chess: AI as a Collaborative Partner&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;!!! note &#34;This is a experimental post, please leave feedback in the comments below&#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;This was a essay written by ChatGPT given a quick transcript of a 5 minute mono-logue.

Kojima advocates for giving players a rope, not a stick, signifying support that encourages exploration and personal growth.

I could discuss overcoming plateaus or developing mastery, learning for the joy of learning. I could also talk about how to avoid feeling overwhelmed by new topics and break them down into smaller pieces. However, I think that has been done before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, I&#39;m going to explore a new style.

I&#39;ll illustrate how everyday tools employed in system monitoring and debugging can be effectively harnessed to enhance AI agents. Using Open Telemetry, we&#39;ll delve into creating comprehensive telemetry for intricate agent actions, spanning from question answering to autonomous decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;!!! question &#34;What is Open Telemetry?&#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Essentially, Open Telemetry comprises a suite of APIs, tools, and SDKs that facilitate the creation, collection, and exportation of telemetry data (such as metrics, logs, and traces). This data is crucial for analyzing and understanding the performance and behavior of software applications.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</description><link>https://jxnl.github.io/blog/writing/2023/04/04/good-llm-observability/</link> <pubDate>Sun, 21 Jan 2024 19:10:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://jxnl.github.io/blog/feed_rss_updated.xml">jxnl.co</source><guid isPermaLink="true">https://jxnl.github.io/blog/writing/2023/04/04/good-llm-observability/</guid> <enclosure url="https://jxnl.github.io/blog/assets/images/social/writing/posts/llmops.png" type="image/png" length="50378" /> </item> <item> <title>How to build a terrible RAG system</title> <author>jxnl</author> <category>Language Models</category> <category>Query Understanding</category> <category>Retrieval Augmented Generation</category> <category>Search Systems</category> <description>&lt;h1&gt;How to build a terrible RAG system&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;ve seen any of my work, you know that the main message I have for anyone building a RAG system is to think of it primarily as a recommendation system. Today, I want to introduce the concept of inverted thinking to address how we should approach the challenge of creating an exceptional system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;!!! note &#34;What is inverted thinking?&#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Inversion is the practice of thinking through problems in reverse. It&#39;s the practice of “inverting” a problem - turning it upside down - to see it from a different perspective. In its most powerful form, inversion is asking how an endeavor could fail, and then being careful to avoid those pitfalls.

However throught the past year of &lt;a href=&#34;https://jxnl.co&#34;&gt;helping startups&lt;/a&gt; integrate LLMs into their stack I&#39;ve noticed that the pattern of taking user queries, embedding them, and directly searching a vector store is effectively demoware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;!!! note &#34;What is RAG?&#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Retrival augmented generation (RAG) is a technique that uses an LLM to generate responses, but uses a search backend to augment the generation.

With the absence of standardization and proper performance testing, tracing, and logging, building reliable systems was a struggle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To tackle these problems, I created Flight – a framework that acts as a semantic bridge and integrates multiple systems within Stitch Fix.
